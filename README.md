# CUB3D

Cub3D is a [42](https://42.fr/)'s School project where the main goal is to make a first-person 3D representation of a maze by using raycasting.

Made by:

- [sandoramix](https://github.com/Sandoramix)
- [rileone](https://github.com/PapaleoneIV)

## Final grade

**120/125**

## Supported OS

Theoretically it should work on both Linux and MacOS, but... the keybindings and the `mlx` seem to differ between these OS.

So for now it only supports `Linux` systems.

## Build prerequisites

All tools you might need to build this project:


- `make`
- `build-essential`
- `wget`
- `xorg`
- `libxext-dev`
- `libbsd-dev`
- `unzip`


(Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt install make build-essential wget xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev unzip
```

### How to build

To build the program you have just to run:
```bash
make
```

## How to play

`cub3D` requires one argument which should be the file with texture configurations and the actual map.
there are a few sample maps in [`assets/maps`](assets/maps) folder.

E.g.:
```bash
./cub3D assets/maps/small.cub
```

### Map files

The map files follow these rules:

- The file must have `.cub` extension.
- The first part of the file defines the configuration:
  - Each element firsts information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)) followed by all specific informations for each object:
    - **Nord texture**:
      ```
      NO <path_to_the_north_texture>
      ```
    - **East texture**:
      ```
      EA <path_to_the_east_texture>
      ```
    - **West texture**:
      ```
      WE <path_to_the_west_texture>
      ```
    - **South texture**:
      ```
      SO <path_to_the_south_texture>
      ```
    - **Floor color** (range [0,255], each value separated by comma):
      ```
      F <RED>,<GREEN>,<BLUE>
      ```
    - **Ceiling color** (range [0,255], each value separated by comma):
      ```
      C <RED>,<GREEN>,<BLUE>
      ```
- The map must be composed of only 7 possible characters: `0` for an empty space,
`1` for a wall, whitespace ` ` useful for creating a custom shaped maps (considered as void), and `N`,`S`,`E` or `W` for the playerâ€™s start position and spawning
orientation. 
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.

### Keybindings

These are the implemented keybindings:

#### Player Movement

- **`w`**: Move forward
- **`a`**: Move left
- **`s`**: Move backwards
- **`d`**: Move right

#### Camera movement

- **`Up arrow`**: Look up
- **`Down arrow`**: Look down
- **`Left arrow`**: Look left
- **`Right arrow`**: Look right

#### QUIT

- **`ESC`**: Quit the game

#### Extra features

- **`Space`**: Jump
- **`PageUp`**: Minimap zoom in
- **`PageDown`**: Minimap zoom out
- **`Left Shift`**: Sprint
- **`Left Control`**: Squat/Crouch
- **`Left Alt`**: Guard mode (yeah it's useless but it's beautiful)

#### What is it made of

The game itself is made entirely in C.
The graphics library used here is a **42**'s wrapper for `Xlib` called `mlx`.
Most crazy part is that the whole project (except for `mlx`) is wrote by following [`norminette`](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf)'s rules... :P
